<h3>Why Adopt a Pug?</h3>

<h3>Overview of the Pug Breed</h3>
    
<p>Pugs have an endearing appearance. They are prone to very comical expressions, and they have an even temperament. They are also highly intelligent, which makes it easy to see why they are a popular choice for a family pet or a single person looking for a charming companion.</p>

 <p>Pugs are best suited to people who have a lot of time and love to give, as the breed thrives on human affection. Pugs are exuberant, alert, and show great affection for their owners and everyone else! They love being cuddled and patted and can sometimes get jealous or troubled when your affections are devoted to someone else.</p>
    
<p>Pugs are ideal for families with children, as they are generally patient with children and love to play games. The shape of their mouth prevents them from biting efficiently and this makes them reasonably harmless.</p>
    
<p>Pugs are among the most gentle and passive of all breeds. They will tolerate the prodding of a child, are not known to nip or bite, and are quite protective of the family and home. However, they are quite fragile, especially as puppies, and should be looked after and supervised when playing.</p>
    
<p>On average, pugs live about 12 years, but they have been known to live well beyond their average life span with proper care and nutrition.</p>
