# HTML-CSS-Mock-Website
I've always had a passion for cars and decided to use that as the basis of this mock website. This business is called Import AutoWerkz. 
This webpage outlines the services and vehicles available using a simple and straightforward design.
This started as a final project for a web development course, so the design showcases different elements of HTML like greying out some of the photos and different size picture.
This is meant to be a proof of concept for some of the basic elements of HTML/CSS
